# When To Stop Drafting

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/dglynch/WhenToStopDrafting.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/dglynch/WhenToStopDrafting)

The goal of this project is to help players of *Magic: The Gathering Arena* decide when to stop drafting the current
set and open all their booster packs, especially if they are following
[Rich Stein's MTG Arena Free to Play Guide](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2020/09/mtg-arena-zendikar-rising-free-to-play-guide/).

Currently, the program reads your ZNR collection and your inventory of unopened ZNR booster packs from your Player.log
file. It summarizes both, and tells you how many actual rare cards (not mythic rares or wildcards) you can expect to
open from those packs. More features will be added in the future. Contributions and criticism are welcome.
