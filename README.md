# When To Stop Drafting

The goal of this project is to help players of *Magic: The Gathering Arena* decide when to stop drafting the current
set and open all their booster packs, especially if they are following
[Rich Stein's MTG Arena Free to Play Guide](https://www.hipstersofthecoast.com/2020/09/mtg-arena-zendikar-rising-free-to-play-guide/).

Currently, the program is only capable of reading the player's collection data from the game log, and printing it to
the console. The remaining features will be added in the future. The project is not useful yet, but contributions
and criticism are welcome.
